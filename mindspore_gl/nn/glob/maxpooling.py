class MaxPooling(GNNCell):
    r"""
    Apply maximum pooling to the nodes in the batched graph.

    .. math::
        r^{(i)} = \max_{k=1}^{N_i}\left( x^{(i)}_k \right)

    Inputs:
        - **x** (Tensor) - The input node features to be updated. The shape is :math:`(N, D)`
          where :math:`N` is the number of nodes, and :math:`D` is the feature size of nodes.
        - **g** (BatchedGraph) - The input graph.

    Outputs:
        - **x** (Tensor) - The output representation for graphs. The shape is :math:`(2, D_{out})`
          where :math:`D_{out}` is the feature size of nodes.

    Supported Platforms:
        ``Ascend`` ``GPU``
